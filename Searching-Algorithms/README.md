##### Linear Search
* We need to iterate all the elements to find our specific element from Array.
* It's  call `Linear Growth Rate` in Big O Notations `O(n)`.

##### Binary Search
* First we need to sort all the elements then we'll find selected element.
* It's called `O(log n)`
* After sorting we need to divide array in every iteration into small Array until we'll find out required element.
* Every Time we'll compare to our required value with mid element.
    - We need to compare requiredElement with middleElement

##### Recursion Search
* In this algorithm method will call himself again and again
* Definitely if we are not putting some condition it will go infinite calls till a stack overflow exception occurs.
